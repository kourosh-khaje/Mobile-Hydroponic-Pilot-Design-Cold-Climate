# Hydroponic Pilot Design - Cold Climate

## Overview

This study aims to develop an integrated estimation model to design a hydroponic pilot plant that calculates the system's total energy demand and net water consumption. The model will provide essential design parameters for optimizing resource efficiency and operational sustainability.

## Features

•	Multi-crop FEED Analysis: Calculate energy, water, and CAPEX requirements

•	Profit Optimization: Find the most profitable crop allocation mix

•	Price Sensitivity Analysis: Heat-map visualization of profit vs. selling prices

•	Automated Layout Generation: 2D PFD showing electrical and nutrient distribution

•	Unit Conversions: Support for metric and imperial units

•	Configuration Management: JSON-based configuration system

•	Comprehensive Reporting: Text, bar charts, and heat-map outputs


## Methodology 

Brute-force optimization algorithm testing all possible tower combinations across crops, calculating profit for each mix based on 10-year CAPEX amortization, selling prices, and annual yields. Energy/water calculations use standard greenhouse engineering principles with DLI-based lighting requirements and climate-dependent HVAC loads.

## Applications 

• Research institutions: Benchmarking vertical farming economics and resource efficiency 

• Industry stakeholders: FEED analysis for pilot plant design and investment decisions 

• Policy makers: Data-driven assessment of controlled environment agriculture potential 

• Investors: Risk-return evaluation with sensitivity analysis across price scenarios
